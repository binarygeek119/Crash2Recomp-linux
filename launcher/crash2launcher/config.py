    #
    #   CORRECTION to what was recorded here: native-wide does NOT need
    #   per-game viewport data. The runtime derives the reveal from the live
    #   display width and the target aspect (gpu.c ws_nw_configured_offset),
    #   which is 85 px per side for Crash 2's 512-wide display at 16:9. The
    #   original "nw_extra stays 0" reading was native-wide never ACTIVATING -
    #   it is gated on the gameplay detector - and predates gte_game_mode being
    #   turned on below.
    #
    #   Keep it False, but for the COST, not the reason previously given here.
    #   The "reveals 170 px that provably contain no geometry" claim was
    #   RETRACTED: it generalised from a single overhang sample. A 78,769-prim
    #   draw census then found 5,735 primitives extending past the canonical
    #   window (xmin -429, xmax 629 against 512). Geometry does reach into the
    #   margins.
    #
    #   The real reason to leave it False: mode 2 costs ~280 MB of GL surfaces
    #   at supersampling 5, for a reveal the cheaper squash already delivers.
    #   Both modes widen the same field of view - mode 1 squashes the
    #   projection, mode 2 renders extra columns - so this is a quality/memory
    #   trade, not a capability one. Toggle it live with the debug server's
    #   `ws_nw` command instead of shipping it on.
    #   Until patch 0047 mode 2 also dropped every polygon lying wholly inside
    #   a revealed margin: the game's per-polygon screen test still checked
    #   [0,512). The runtime now re-decides that test for native-wide, so both
