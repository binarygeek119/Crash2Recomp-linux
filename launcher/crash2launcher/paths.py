"""Filesystem layout resolution.

The launcher runs in two shapes and has to find its files in both:

* **Player** - the shipped bundle. ``Crash2.exe`` sits beside ``psx-runtime.exe``,
  ``game.toml`` and ``data/``. Everything is one flat folder.
* **Workspace** - the development tree. The launcher runs from source and the
  generated project lives under ``_build/Crash2Recomp/``.

Getting this wrong is the classic "works in dev, broken once packaged" bug, so
mode detection is explicit and every path flows from :func:`app_dir`.
